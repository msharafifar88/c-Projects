What I have learned:

I have studies about different concepts in this workshop. Firstly i learn
about anonymous struct that has no name and tag I learn about its declaration
and useage. I also learned about copy constructor and copy assignment operator 
and move constructor and move assignment operator and their implementation 
.Moreover I learn about chrono library and obeject creation. I also learn
about some built in function like now and how can we use them as stop watch
to start and stop the time.

Question 1: the reason for the difference between the copy and move operations

There is a difference in the way, you should take the parameter.
Copy assignment should take its parameter by a const lvalue reference (&), because you should not change the source of your assignment
Move assignment should take its parameter by a non-const rvalue reference (&&), because you have to modify the source of your assignment

Question 2: the dynamic allocation of addresses to objects instead of objects themselves 

There are two ways that memory gets allocated for data storage 
1. Compile Time (or static) Allocation
2. Dynamic Memory Allocation
In dynamic memory allocation we allocate memory dynamically of addresses to obeject 
but not of obeject themselves.The main difference is the storage duration of the object.
if we try do with obeject itself which mean it wil destroyed itself automatically
when it goes out of scope.When you do with the addresses of obeject which means 
it stays alive until you explicitly delete it. the object has dynamic storage 
duration, which means it stays alive until you explicitly delete it. 
You should only use dynamic storage duration when you need it. 


Quiz Reflection:
Q3:
Wrong Answer: shape* shap = shape();
		   shape* shap = cube();


Right Answer: shape* shap =  new shape();
		 Shape& shap = new cube();
