1)Why do you need to allocate new dynamic memory for the entire array when you increase the size of an existing array of dynamically allocated memory? Why not allocate memory only for the new element?\
\pard\pardeftab720\sl280\partightenfactor0
\cf4 \
Answer:  As per the rules, dynamic memory is basically a memory that is taken for some time from the system, as we already used the previously allocated  memory for the previous elements, so now we don\'92t  have  an                dynamic memory left, if we are adding a new element then we have to request system  for the memory allocation for that new member.\

2)The CellPhone structure stores the model of the cellphone in an array of characters. At the end of the program, we do not use the delete operator to deallocate the memory occupied by the model.why we need to use the delete operator on this array itself? Explain and compare with the array of cellphones.\
\
Answer:   In cellphone structure, model of the cellphone is stored in an array of characters, and that  allocation is done in static memory, so we do not need to use any delete operator to delicate the static  memory as                according to the study static memory gets returned to the system by itself after running of program.\

\
3)There are two display(...) function definitions. How does the compiler know which definition to call from your main function?\
\
Answer:    Compiler can understand from the definitions of the function as both times, the display() function has different definitions both the times, because, for first time we are just adding the reference to pPhones pointer from the CellPhone struct, in second it contains the size of array also.\
