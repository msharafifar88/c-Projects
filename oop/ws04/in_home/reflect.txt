\fs21 \cf0 1) What is a safe empty state? Could you define another state as the safe empty state?\'a0\
\
Answer:\'a0\
\
  each member of your class should either have a default constructor that will leave the member in a safe/empty state (like std::Traveler::Traveler()) or you should initialize the member to a safe value.\
\
plain data type like int, float, bool do not have a default constructor so you should assign a safe or empty value to each instance of the member based on how the class will use the member.\
\
2)Describe how you have minimized code duplication.\'a0\
\
Answer:\
 \'a0 By using the keyword this ,so I create\'a0 temporary objects to access validation logic localized within one constructor.\'a0 the temporary object to the current object (*this)\'a0\
\
\
3)Explain why the canTravelWith(...) member function can access the pri-vate data of the object referenced in its parameter.\'a0\
\
Answer: \'a0\
 \'a0 bool canTravelWith(const Traveler&) const;\
\
because the canTravelWith is declared as\'a0private class and only The class\'a0members can be accessed by the functions inside the class. They are not allowed to be accessed directly by any object or function outside the class. Only the member functions or the\'a0friend functions\'a0are allowed to access the private data members of a class.\
Also, When a function is declared as const, it can be called on any type of object.\
