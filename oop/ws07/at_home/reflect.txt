1. Does the Hero class need to know about the existence of the SuperHero class? (Hint: do a search in Hero.cpp, does the word “SuperHero” appear anywhere?)


No, the hero class is the base class and does not need to know about the Derived class with is SuperHero class ,and the hero class is not dependent on superhero class.

2. Does the SuperHero class need to know about the existence of the Hero class? (Hint: do a search in SuperHero.cpp, does the word “Hero” appear anywhere?)

Yes, the superHero class is derived class  of Hero which is the Base class so the child class object are connected to the parent class so the a derived class object contains the intense variable of the base class.


3. The program prints out “Ancient Battle!” when 2 Heroes fight. It prints out “Super Fight!” when 2 SuperHeroes fight. When you tried to make a Hero fight a SuperHero , what did it print out?

The program printed out "Ancient Battle!" because at this stage there is fight between Hero and superhero so in this condition we only one side of ur fight have super attack, the we call the * operator that is being used is Hero.cpp, not the one from the SuperHero class.
